# Extensions

Extensions are a way to extend the behavior of ERC-7579. Extensions can be used to standardize a subset of smart accounts or modules, such as, for example, further standardizing security safeguards around module usage. To encompass this, we encourage members of the community to create extensions to this standard, by creating new ERCs that extend the behavior of ERC-7579. For example, an ERC might use the title “[FEATURE] Extension for ERC-7579” to indicate that it is an extension to the standard.
