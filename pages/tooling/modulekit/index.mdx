# ModuleKit

**A development kit for building smart account modules**

ModuleKit aims to make it simple for any developer to build a module that works across all ERC-7579 compliant accounts, including Safe, ZeroDev's Kernel V3, Biconomy's Nexus, and many more.

ModuleKit has several tools to help during the development lifecycle of a module:

**Build**

- **Standardized interfaces and templates**: These ensure that your module is compatible with all the major account implementations and that it's extremely easy to get started.
- **Third-party integrations**: ModuleKit has a library of integrations and pre-built conditions for execution to make building powerful modules seamless.

**Test**

- **Testing frameworks**: These are out-of-the-box testing setups with in-built unit and integration tests. They allow developers to easily test modules against different account implementations and abstract away the complexities of the entire ERC-4337 flow.
- **Helper utilities**: These utilities improve the developer experience, such as calculating gas consumption (including on L2s) and validating that a module conforms to the ERC-4337 rules.

**Deploy**

- **Deployment script**: The ModuleKit comes with a helper contract that allows you to easily deploy a module and register it in the Module Registry.

## Supported Accounts

- [ERC-7579](/) - Any ERC-7579 compliant account
- [Nexus](https://github.com/bcnmy/nexus) - Biconomy's Nexus
- [Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel) - ZeroDev's Kernel
- [Safe](https://github.com/rhinestonewtf/safe7579) - Safe with Safe7579 adapter

## Supported Module Types

* **Validators**: determine whether a transaction is valid and should be executed
* **Executors**: create executions on the account with custom logic
* **Hooks**: enforce conditions or execute logic pre- or post-execution
* **Fallbacks**: extend the account logic to add more functionality into the account
