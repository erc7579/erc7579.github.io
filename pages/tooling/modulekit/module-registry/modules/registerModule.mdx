title: "registerModule"
---

Register a deployed module on the Registry. Note that the deployer of the module will be stored as the zero address in the Registry since this function can be front-run.

## Usage

```solidity
ResolverUID resolverUID = ResolverUID.wrap(...);
address moduleAddress = address(...);
bytes memory metadata = "";
bytes memory resolverContext = "";

address moduleAddress = registry.registerModule(resolverUID, moduleAddress, metadata, resolverContext);
```

## Parameters

### resolverUID

- Type: `ResolverUID | bytes32`

The resolver UID to use for the module deployment. You can find the default resolver UID in the [address book](../../../home/resources/address-book).

### moduleAddress

- Type: `address`

The address of the module to register.

### metadata

- Type: `bytes`

Additional metadata to store on the Registry. This can be left empty.

### resolverContext

- Type: `bytes`

Additional context to pass to the resolver. This can be left empty.
