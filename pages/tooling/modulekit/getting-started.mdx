# Getting Started

ModuleKit is built on top of [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), a toolchain to simplify and speed up smart contract development. If you are not familiar with Foundry, feel free to check out their docs and install it by running:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
