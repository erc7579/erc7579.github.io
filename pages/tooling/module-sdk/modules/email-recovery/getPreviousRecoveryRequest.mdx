# getPreviousRecoveryRequest

Get details about the previous recovery request for an account, including the guardian who initiated it and the cooldown period for cancellation.

## Usage

```typescript
const previousRequest = await getPreviousRecoveryRequest({
  account: {
    address: '0x123...',
    type: 'safe',
    deployedOnChains: [8453],
    initCode: '0x...' // optional
  },
  client: publicClient,
})
```

## Parameters

### account

- Type: [`Account`](/tooling/module-sdk/glossary/types.mdx#account)

The account object.

### client

- Type: `PublicClient`

The public client instance used to interact with the blockchain.

## Returns

### previousRequest

- Type: `Promise<{previousGuardianInitiated: Address; cancelRecoveryCooldown: bigint}>`

Object containing:
- `previousGuardianInitiated`: The address of the guardian who initiated the previous recovery request
- `cancelRecoveryCooldown`: The timestamp until which new recovery requests are blocked after cancellation

If the contract call fails, returns `{previousGuardianInitiated: zeroAddress, cancelRecoveryCooldown: 0n}`.
